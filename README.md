# NewApproachProgramming

## Project Brief

## Overview
This project is designed to process and analyze large log files using a multi-threaded C++ server-client architecture. The server receives data, calculates statistics (average, minimum, maximum, median), and sends the results back to the client. The client sends the log data to the server for processing.

## Key Components
TCPServer: A multi-threaded server that listens for incoming connections, processes the received log data, calculates statistics, and returns the results.

TCPClient: A client that connects to the server, sends log data, and receives statistical results.

LogProcessor: Handles reading, processing, and extracting relevant information from large log files efficiently.

Log File Handling: The project utilizes a zipped file of log data (LogFiles.zip), which is extracted automatically using a script for easier access.

## Features
Multi-threaded server and client for concurrent data processing.

Statistics calculation: average, minimum, maximum, and median for a list of numbers.

Easy log extraction and setup with automated scripts.
