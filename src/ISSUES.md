# Known Issues and Solutions

## Log Processing Challenges
- Original implementation only processed .log files, not .json/.txt/.xml
- File paths weren't handled with recursive traversal
- XML parser implementation was incomplete

## Multi-threading Implementation
- Added parallel processing for multiple log files
- Used thread synchronization with mutexes

## Parser Improvements
- Enhanced JSON parser to correctly handle the log structure
- Fixed date range filtering to properly select logs
